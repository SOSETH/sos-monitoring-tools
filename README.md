# sos-monitoring-tools
Tools and scripts required by SOSETH monitoring roles. This is a work in progress,
not all tools have been packaged yet.

## Usage
Install dependencies (TODO: List deps) and do
```
./build.sh
```
After a while, you should end up with a bunch of debian packages in out, which
you can then publish in some repository (or use ours).
